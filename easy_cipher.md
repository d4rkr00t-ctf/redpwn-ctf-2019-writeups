## easy cipher
> This is an [easy cipher](./files/easy_cipher.html)? I heard it's broken.

Only some part of code is necessary for analysis to solve this challenge.

At the end of script, you will find
```
if(calcMD5(prompt(_0x29a9[5]))=== _0x29a9[6]){alert(_0x29a9[7])}else {alert(_0x29a9[8])}
```
So basically, we have to find the password whose md5 hash is `aa42b234cb05915716c1434058fe1aee16c14340cb059157aa42b234`

Searching it online in md5 db, we quickly get a hit - `shazam`. Flag - `redpwnctf{shazam}`
